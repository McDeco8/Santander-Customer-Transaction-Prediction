# Customer Transaction Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer transactions using Python. The p

roject leverages the **Santander Customer Transaction Dataset** and uses various machine learning techniques to achieve predictive insights.

---

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To predict whether a customer will make a transaction based on the provided features.
- **Dataset**: Features and labels provided by Santander.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  - Model training and evaluation

---

## Key Files

### 1. Jupyter Notebook

- **`Final CTP.ipynb`**: Contains the entire workflow, including:
  - Data loading and visualization
  - Model training and evaluation

### 2. Python Scripts

- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Prepares data by handling missing values, feature scaling, and transformations.
- **`train_model.py`**: Trains machine learning models and evaluates their performance.
- **`predict.py`**: Loads the saved model (`model.pkl`) and makes predictions on new data.

### 3. Saved Model

- **`model.pkl`**: Serialized machine learning model for prediction purposes.

### 4. Dependencies

- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python libraries needed to run the project.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-transaction-prediction.git
   cd customer-transaction-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Final\ CTP.ipynb
   ```

4. To execute the Python scripts:

   - Run preprocessing:
     ```bash
     python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
     ```
   - Train the model:
     ```bash
     python scripts/train_model.py
     ```
   - Make predictions:
     ```bash
     python scripts/predict.py
     ```
